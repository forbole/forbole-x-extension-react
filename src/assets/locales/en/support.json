When used in sequence they allow access to the cryptocurrencies associated with that wallet.  \n\n It is **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** to keep your secret recovery phrase **safe**, as you would need them to restore a wallet, and if someone else gets hold of the phrase, they can **remove** your funds.  \n\n Read more [here](https://www.forbole.com/blog/yi-ding-yao-bao-guan-hao-qian-bao-zhu-ji-ci)."

    "staking": {
      "title": "Staking",
      "q1": {
        "question": "What is staking?",
        "answer": "The action that token holders delegate their tokens to validators to **secure the network** is called staking. \n\n Staked tokens are eligible to **receive** staking rewards. \n\n Newly minted tokens and transactions fees are given out as **rewards** to bonded staking token holders.  \n\n Delegators stake their staking power to validators, but that **does not** mean the validators possess or have custody of the tokens delegated to them. \n\n In other words, validators **cannot** steal or take away delegators’ tokens. Your delegated amount of tokens **will not** be decreased in most situations, \n\n however, if your validator is punished by slashing, your delegated token is at **risk** of being slashed too (see below for “slashing”)."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What are delegating, undelegating, and redelegating?",
        "answer": "The action of **staking** tokens is called delegating. \n\n The **reverse** action is called undelegating. \n\n And redelegating lets you **transfer** your delegations from one validator to another, it happens instantly without waiting the 14-day unbonding period. \n\n Your rewards will **keep calculating** if you choose to redelegate. \n\n Your rewards will **stop calculating** once you choose undelegating.  \n\n There is no minimum time required before delegating or redelegating after delegated your tokens. \n\n But do **make sure** you have sufficient funds in your available balance to pay for the transaction fee."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Why can't I redelegate my token?",
        "answer": "You need to **wait** a certain period of time after the first redelegation. \n\n The period of time will be as **same** as the unbonding period (14-day)."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Which validator should I delegate to?",
        "answer": "You may refer to the following guides: [How to delegate your DSM? My two cents, Big Dipper FAQ.](https://bigdipper.live/faq)"
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "How much staking rewards can I expect by delegating?",
        "answer": "It depends on many variables, but can be approximately calculated."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Why did my staking rewards drop?",
        "answer": "There are a few possible reasons:  \n\n - Inflation changed due to Parameter change Proposal   \n\n - Bonding ratio changed (usually the higher bonding ratio, the lower the inflation rate) \n\n - Your validator(s) increased their commission rate"
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Any risks associated with delegating?",
        "answer": "There may be some risks when your validator is suffering a **slash**. This happens because: \n\n - Downtime (0.01% of the stake will slashed)  \n\n - Double Sign (5% of the stake will slashed)"
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "How often should I claim my staking rewards?",
        "answer": "There is **no** model answer because this depends on too many factors,\n\n  including how many tokens staked, transaction fees in that particular network, etc."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "I delegate to multiple validators. Can I claim my staking rewards in one go?",
        "answer": "Yes, tap **“Withdraw all”** on the DashBoard and it is possible to claim all your staking rewards in one single transaction."
      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "What is the unbonding period and how long does it take?",
        "answer": "Unbonding is an on-chain parameterized period of time upon which all the delegators must wait for their tokens to return fully available. \n\n It starts when you remove from the staking status, your tokens are **locked**. \n\n The unbonding period **lasts 14 days**, ensuring a variety of security measures in the specific network.  \n\n In these 14 days, you will **not** be able to do any type of operation with your tokens and you **will not** receive any staking rewards. \n\n **Once** you’ve undelegate, the unbonding period begins."

      "q11": {
        "question": "Can I relegate my token to another validator?",
